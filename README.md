# Aracy: The Micro-Affection Gamified Ecosystem

_"Aracy" — Mother of the Day in ancient myth, the bond that brings warmth through the darkest hours. This project embodies the sacred alchemy of modern kinship, forged through language, luminous code, and celestial design._

## ☀️ Vision

Aracy is a gamified PWA for sharing personalized "alints": poetic, affectionate pet names and micro-compliments conjured through AI and ritualized bonding. Every user navigates between the roles of **Alchemist** and **Muse**. Each bond is unique, glowing as a gold-threaded connection in the Goth-Celestial night.

## 🎨 Aesthetic

- **Theme:** Goth-Celestial (Deep Black #0a0a0c, Gold #d4af37, Royal Purple #4b006e)
- **Experience:** Ethereal. Elegant. Playful, with streaks, codes, and rituals as daily acts of digital affection.
- **Technology as Art:** The architecture is poetry—each module a stanza in the constellation of care.

## 🧪 Tech Stack

- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python), modular architecture (Gemini LLM integration, Pydantic models, logging, /api endpoints)
- **Frontend:** React + Vite, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, PWA-ready
- **Database:** Supabase SQL (users, bonds, profiles, alint logs, streaks)
- **AI:** Google Gemini, extensible with “Affection Laws” (custom modules)

## 🚦 Quick Start

1. **Backend:**  
   - `cd backend`  
   - `pip install -r requirements.txt`  
   - `uvicorn main:app --reload`
2. **Frontend:**  
   - `cd frontend`
   - `npm install`
   - `npm run dev`
3. Point your device to `localhost:5173` and let the gold-glow flow.
