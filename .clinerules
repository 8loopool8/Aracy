# ARACY: THE GOTH-ASTRO-ALCHEMY BUILD RULES

## 1. PROJECT VISION
- **Purpose:** A PWA for "Alints" (pet names/deep compliments) sent between bonded partners.
- **Vibe:** Goth-Celestial-Pastel. Dark backgrounds, gold accents, purple glows, elegant typography.
- **Core Loop:** Sender (The Alchemist) schedules content at night -> Receiver (The Muse) gets it at 06:00 AM.

## 2. TECH STACK & ARCHITECTURE
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python). 
- **Frontend:** React (Vite) + Tailwind CSS + Framer Motion (for animations).
- **AI:** Gemini Integration (Flexible Model Picker: tries Gemini 2.0 Flash/Pro or latest available).
- **DB & Auth:** Supabase (Postgres).
- **Code Style:** Strict separation of "Affection Laws" (AI Prompt Logic) and "Interface" (UI Logic).

## 3. KEY FEATURES TO IMPLEMENT
- **Bonding Engine:** Code-based linking (ex: 'PETALA-ROZ-2026').
- **Mirror Profiles:** A dashboard for A to define B's traits and vice versa.
- **The Batcher:** Support for scheduling 3 types of daily alints (Silly, Deep, Astro).
- **Gamification:** - Streaks (Star-Flames).
    - GitHub-style activity grid (Connection Heatmap).
    - Quiz Mode: Unlockable Badges with Framed animations.
- **Astro-Logic:** A service that maps daily transits to alints based on birth charts.

## 4. OPEN SOURCE & PORTFOLIO STANDARDS
- All code must be clean, commented, and follow PEP8 (Python) and ESLint (React).
- Auto-generate `README.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` to explain the "Alchemy" of the app.
- Ensure 'The Resource Footprint' (memory usage/AI tokens) is logged for performance tracking.
